Submit the .java files for the following questions:

1. Write a Java program that prompts the user to enter two integers and
    displays their sum. Use exception handling to prompt the user for
    reading the number again if the input is incorrect.

2. Write a Java program that meets the following requirements:
    - Creates an array with 100 randomly chosen integers.
    - Prompts the user to enter the index of the array, then displays the
        corresponding element value. If the specified index is out of
        bounds, display the message Out of Bounds.

3. Write a Java program that prompts the user to enter a number between
    0 and 10 and displays the entered number. Use an "assert statement"
    to determine whether the user entered a number within the valid
    range. If the user entered a number that is out of range, the
    program must report an error with assertion error message
    "The entered number is out of range".
