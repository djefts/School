%I assume you will introduce the concept of Fuzzy testing, how it is used, where it is used, advantages disadvantages, etc. etc.   If this is correct, you are good to go.

	\textbf{\textit{THIS IS NOT MY ABSTRACT}} Software engineering researchers solve problems of several different kinds. To do so, they produce  several different kinds of results, and they should develop appropriate evidence to validate these results. They often report their research in conference papers. I analyzed the abstracts of research papers submitted to ICSE 2002 in order to identify the types of research reported in the submitted and accepted papers, and I observed the program committee discussions about which papers to accept. This report presents the research paradigms of the papers, common concerns of the program committee, and statistics on success rates. This information should help researchers design better research projects and write papers that present their results to best advantage. 
	
	This paper makes the case for TaaS—automated software testing as a cloud-based service. We present three kinds of TaaS: a “programmer’s sidekick” enabling developers to thoroughly and promptly test their code with minimal upfront resource investment; a “home edition” on-demand testing service for consumers to verify the software they are about to install on their PC or mobile device; and a public “certification service,” akin to Underwriters Labs, that independently assesses the reliability, safety, and security of software.
	TaaS automatically tests software, without human involvement from the service user’s or provider’s side. This is unlike today’s “testing as a service” businesses, which employ humans to write tests. Our goal is to take recently proposed techniques for automated testing—even if usable only on toy programs—and make them practical by modifying them to harness the resources of compute clouds. Preliminary work suggests it is technically feasible to do so, and we find that TaaS is also compelling from a social and business point of view.

\section{Introduction}
	\IEEEPARstart{E}{nsuring} that software works properly before public (or private) release is important because software bugs, or in-code errors, can cost the developing company a lot of money. Software bugs cause program faults, and faults cause program failures. Maintenance and repair is 65-85\% of system cost \cite{slides}. Naturally, the goal during software development is to limit these defects by testing the software before release. However, "software testing is a very labor intensive and costly task, [and] many software testing techniques to automate the process of software testing have been [designed and] reported in the literature" \cite{fuzzy-logic}. Reportedly, a largely effective software testing technique is called \textit{Assertion-Based} \cite{assertion-testing}. It involves finding program inputs in which various assertions are violated. When these assertions are violated then there is a fault in the program \cite{assertion-testing}.
