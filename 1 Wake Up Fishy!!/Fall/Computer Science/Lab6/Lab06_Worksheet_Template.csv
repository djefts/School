1. What is blackbox testing?,,,,,,,
Testing before viewing the code,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
2. What is whitebox testing?,,,,,,,
Testing while looking at and changing the source code,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
3. Why are boundary values particularly important to consider when developing test cases?,,,,,,,
To make sure the source code has the correct bounds in it,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
4. Why is it important to know which requirement is being tested by a particular test case?,,,,,,,
To keep track of what requirements have and haven't been met,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
